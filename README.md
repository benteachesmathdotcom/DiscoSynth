# DiscoSynth
This is the v0 prototype of my DiscoSynth project! The synth is running on a Teensy 4.1 with the Audio Shield. This GitHub project has all the code, schematics, and documentation for the project. I also made a video to show family and friends the project, but figure it may be useful here as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PleBgo9BrUU

I am looking forward to getting feedback on what I have so far as I get ready for some big upgrades in V1, including:
* Fully soldered with PCB - no more breadboard!
* A more robust signal chain to make more awesome synth sounds
* Many many more knobs, buttons, switches, etc. to control all the new parameters in the signal chain
* MIDI input
